= Range-Resolver Maven Plugin

== Overview

The _rangeresolver-maven-plugin_ is a Maven Plugin that aims to ease some pain points
encountered when using version ranges - early identification of unintended API breakages.

== How?

The basic idea is:

- always compile against the lower bound of a given range
- always test/package against the upper bound of a given range

When working on a code sprint, often you adapt your API concurrently with the
implementation hand in hand, without thought about the impact against downstream users.

- By always compiling against the lower bound, you're enforcing the source/binary contract
  for a consistent API, any breakages should trigger an update to the lower bound of your
  range.
- By testing/packaging against the upper bound, you're enforcing the _semantic_ contract
  for non-breaking changes.
